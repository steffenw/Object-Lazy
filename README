Object::Lazy version 0.08
=========================

Create objects late from non-owned classes.

This module implements lazy evaluation
and can create lazy objects from every class.

Creates a dummy object including a subroutine
which knows how to build the real object.

Later, if a method of the object is called,
the real object will be built.

Inherited methods from UNIVERSAL.pm are implemented and so overwritten.
This are isa, DOES, can and VERSION.
